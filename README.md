# three-body-problem

MVC Final Project 2024
------------------------------------------------
threebody_2d.py runs the simulation using 2d plotting, and threebody_3d.py runs the simulation using 3d plotting, both from Matplotlib.
Playing around with initial configurations and the number of steps can yield interesting results. 
For conceptual and mathematical background, see my paper threebody.pdf.
