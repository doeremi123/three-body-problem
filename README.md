# three-body-problem

MVC Final Project 2024
------------------------------------------------
threebody_2d.py runs the simulation using 2d plotting, and threebody_3d.py runs the simulation using 3d plotting, both from Matplotlib.
Playing around with initial configurations and the number of steps can yield interesting results. 
For conceptual and mathematical background, see my paper threebody.pdf.

Results: 

threebody_0 and threebody_1 demonstrate the chaotic nature of the system as I changed the initial configurations by <0.01 and led to a large change in motion. 

threebody_2 starts out with Euler's solution then goes on to act chaotically demonstrating its instability.

threebody_3 shows Lagrange's solution with equal masses.

threebody_4 shows the restricted three-body problem with the red path being the smaller mass.

threebody_5 shows the Figure 8 solution.
